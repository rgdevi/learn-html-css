    <h1>Letters to my Sweet Daughter</h1>
<h3>Your mom learning Html.. like you drawing A C L X V..</h3>
<p id="bio_1">Being a mother is not easy and to me it didn't come naturally as they say. My mom use to tell me don't even worry about that, daughters will know how to get that from their moms. How to get their love, their time, their space.. very true!</p>
<p id="bio_2"> It all started very happy, we started preparing for you- started a small saving for you, shopping - that was fun we didnt even know that you were a <b>girl</b>,but we bought cute dresses :)<i>(okay! listen your daddy hates the word cute, pink, princess LOL!)</i>We use to have talks about who you will become, what you would <strong>want</strong> to be, what your        <em>likes</em> will be, will you be a vegetarain?<i>(yes! of course as you think, thats from me)</i>I use to think if you become some scientist and find out some crazy stuff like:<br /><q>The Earth gets one hundred tons heavier everyday due to falling space dust</q> or <q>The moon is drfiting is away from the Earth</q> etc..<br />or may may be some equation like E=MC<sup>2</sup>,or some one who calculates mass of CO<sub>2</sub> it would be really cool!or being a scientist in <acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</acronym>or some <abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> with lot of specialization leading some research programs...publishing books <cite>Black hole in Space</cite> totally thinking of you as a genius <dfn>Mis. Smarty Pants!!</dfn><em>no pressure,</em><del>huge hopeson you!</del> <ins>LOL ! think this way-its actually pressure on us as parents to save more for your education:P, so mommy has to buckle up and learn and try out new things which she has never done before!</ins></p><hr />
